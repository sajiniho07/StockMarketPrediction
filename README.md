Stock Market Analysis
===
## Introduction
This is a Python script for analyzing stock market data. The script reads in data from a CSV file, calculates the derivative of the closing prices and plots it against the day values. It also predicts whether or not the stock price will increase based on blocks of 10 days.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

## Installation & use
Clone or download the repository.
- for train
  ```
  python project.py
  ```
## Usage  
Run the script.
The script will output two plots:
A basic plot of the closing prices against the day values.
A plot of the derivative of the closing prices against the day values.
The script will also output an array of predictions indicating whether the stock price is predicted to increase or decrease based on blocks of 10 days.

## Code Explanation
The script reads data from a CSV file using the read_csv method from the pandas package. The to_datetime() method is used to convert the date column to a pandas datetime object. The closing prices and day values are extracted from the dataframe and converted to numpy arrays. The script then computes the derivative of the closing prices and plots it against the day values.

The script also creates an array of 10-day blocks of closing prices and uses them to make predictions about whether the stock price will increase or decrease in the following block.

## Limitations
The script assumes that the data is in a specific format: two columns (date and closing price) with no header row.
The script only works with CSV files and requires the pandas package to be installed.
The script does not take into account any external factors that may affect the stock price.
